NHTSAs Vehicle Standards and Harmonization Division of the Office of Chief Counsel is hiring an individual with a demonstrated interest in the intersection of law, science, and technology. Our work is fast-paced and requires curiosity, persistence, and top-notch communication and collaboration skills. Primary tasks include helping to draft explanations of agency policy with interdisciplinary teams of technical experts.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nNHTSA regulates motor vehicle and motor vehicle equipment safety, which puts us right in the middle of the self-driving revolution. NHTSAs safety standards establish minimum performance requirements that have made cars safer for decades, but many existing standards need to evolve to adjust and/or eliminate requirements that may no longer serve a safety purpose in self-driving vehicles that cannot be driven by a human. NHTSA may also need to develop innovative tools (beyond traditional standards) suitable for ensuring the safety of quickly developing and changing new technologies. NHTSA also sets fuel economy standards that determine how far vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline.\nUnder the supervision of an attorney as a Law Clerk , your primary activity will be drafting Federal Register notices establishing or amending safety standards, as a member of interdisciplinary teams of engineers, program analysts, economists, and other technical experts and policy makers. Attorneys in our division are deeply engaged in helping to develop the justifications for the agencys rulemaking actions. As the lead drafter of agency justifications, you will regularly need to be able to understand and synthesize data and analyses about complex technological and economic issues, to explain that there is a problem of sufficient magnitude and importance to warrant regulation, and to do so in an understandable and persuasive manner. You will also analyze planned research, rulemakings, regulatory analyses, and policy position papers, critiquing and helping to bolster the agencys policy, scientific, and economic justifications for regulatory and non-regulatory actions to ensure their soundness and legal sufficiency. In preparation for that work, you will track regulatory, legislative and private sector developments  not just legal, but also technological and economic. You will also work to minimize litigation risks by ensuring that all procedural and substantive requirements are met and that the administrative record supports the agencys actions. If litigation nevertheless ensues, you will work with NHTSAs litigators and the Department of Justice to defend those actions. While you will work primarily with NHTSA staff, you may also consult or collaborate with other agencies affected by NHTSAs work or that face similar challenges in regulating rapidly-changing, software-controlled technology, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Homeland Security, and others, and with the General Counsels Office for the Department of Transportation.\nOther activities include analyzing pending legislation affecting the rulemaking process and/or NHTSA rulemaking authority and actions (e.g., self-driving vehicle bills); and drafting interpretations of the agencys standards and authorizing statutes concerning emerging and evolving technologies. Some current areas of focus at NHTSA that you could work on include:\nAutomated vehiclesdetermining, among other things:\n(1) how safe is safe enough,\n(2) how to demonstrate that a vehicle has achieved that level of safety,\n(3) how to solve the challenges presented by vehicles whose performance capabilities continue to evolve throughout their lifetimes through software updates and machine learning, and\n(4) what combinations of guidance, best practices, and soft and hard law are best suited to address technologies whose rates of development are outpacing conventional approaches to regulation;\nPotential cyber security and information privacy issues associated with advanced motor vehicle technologies;\nStandards improving crash protection for vehicle occupants and pedestrians;\nDeveloping and establishing fuel economy standards, which involves extensive interaction within the Executive Branch, e.g., with the Environmental Protection Agency, and also involves preparation of environmental impact statements;\nInternational regulatory issues  you may also travel abroad, as need requires and funding permits: NHTSA rulemaking attorneys occasionally provide support to the agency as it collaborates with other countries in developing, negotiating and drafting vehicle safety Global Technical Regulations, and also occasionally advise the Office of the U. S. Trade Representative (USTR) regarding and/or participate in trade agreement negotiations on auto sector issues.\nThis position is perfect for a professional who looking to grow with a great Federal agency and is interested in contributing to a highly collaborative environment in which teams of experts work to resolve novel challenges at the intersection of law, science and technology.
